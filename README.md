# Random-words
Random-words is a simple app that shows random words at a configurable interval.  
This can be useful for free-association and improvisation training exercises. The app currently supports two languages: English and Estonian.

# Usage
To use the app, simply visit the [GitHub Pages site](www.test.ee).

# Data source
The English words used in the app are sourced from the google-10000-english repository. The Estonian words are sourced from a similar public dataset.

# Improvements
While the app is functional, there might be improvements to be made. The app was almost completely made with chatGPT.
